# open-mini-rack
Open-source, 3D-printable mini network system for 6-inch and 10-inch wide mini racks, with a variarity of depths of rack and mounting types.

## Design Goals
- Parametric first and foremost so its easy to customise
- Easy to print, minimal overhangs, simple materials (PLA or PETG)
- Based around standard sized M5x20 and M5 nuts for structural components and the rails, M3 sized bolts for sub-structures in panels
- Minimal heatsinks

## Key components
- Rails
- Panels
- Handles
- Base
- Cross-beams
- Cross-beam shelves

## Extra components
- Feet
- Wall mount
- Side panels
- Outer Enclosure

## Rewards and Recognition
I've uploaded the initial main components on Thangs and Printables just to recoup some of the filament used up in all the little mistakes I made along the way.

Further discussion around contibution, rewards and project management 
Initial thoughts any contributors are rewarded by being included in the top level collection, and naturally they upload their work on their own accounts and gain points that way?
